# Instructions

<!-- 

    * For this challenge I used HTML, CSS (bootstrap), and vanilla JavaScript.
      To render the data on screen please open with your live server extension. 
      To change local Json file, please go to "run.js" and manually switch the URL. 
      I look forward to going over and reviewing this code with you, Joe. I'd love to share my thought process. 
      Thank you! *
