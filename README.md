# Testing Instructions for Reviewers

<!-- 

    * For this challenge I used Html, Css, and vanilla JavaScript.
      All a person needs to do to render the information is start up their
      live server extension. To change local Json file, please go to "run.js" and
      manually switch the URL. 
      I look forward to going over and reviewing this code with you, Joe. I'd love to share my though process. *
